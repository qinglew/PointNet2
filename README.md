# PointNet++: Deep Hierarchical Feature Learning on Point Sets in a Metric Space

### Introduction

This project is reproduction for the Paper [PointNet++](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1706.02413.pdf).

### Preparation

* PyCharm
* Anaconda
* NumPy
* PyTorch

Firstly, you need to create a directory named "data" in the root directory. You can execute the scripts I prepared to download dataset or you can use the links given in the scripts to download directly.

### Environment

* Python 3.7
* PyTorch 1.6
* NVIDIA RTX 2060 (6GB)

### Classification

| Model | Number of Points | Input Dropout | Overall Accuracy(%) | Class Avg. Accuracy(%) |
| :---: | :---:| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| SSG | 1024 | True | 89.22 | 86.34 |

Here, I only run the SSG model. Other models will be supplemented later.
